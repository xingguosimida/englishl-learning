As you all know, we're going to produce TV and print Ads for Morning Cup Inc's new instant gourmet coffees. Who would like to begin this brainstorming session? What are you ideas?

Using celebrities is always a good idea

I'm not so sure about that. A lot of ads use celebrities, we need our Ads to stand out.

I agree with you, celebrities come at a high price. We still not sure about the budget for the project.

What do you have in mind?

Well, we could still use people in our ads, how about using commercial models instead, they charge a lot less.

I agree, it seems like you already have a storyboard, may we see it?

It's not done yet, and it may change depending on what we agree today

Alright, what about you xx?

I also thought about using commercial models for our ads, we could use a different ad and a different model for each flavor.

That's interesting

What about you xx? Any ideas?

I agree with xx's idea for using different models for each flavor, but I'm not so sure that is would be a good idea to create four seperate ads Wouldn't that be expensive?

What do you suggest?

Just one Ad for all the flavors, also I suggest we should use same themes for TV and print Ads.

Ok thank you everyone,I'll forward your suggestions to the other department heads, and consult with them, please email me if you come up with more ideas?
