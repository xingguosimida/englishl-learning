Todd takes a nap every day during his lunch break, one day, a new manager Tina, talked to him about his habit.

Hi Todd, do you get enough sleep at night? I noticed you always sleep during your lunch break.
Well, yes Tina, I do get enough sleep at night, napping is a habit I started when the doctor advised me to loss weight, I found out that it makes me feel better than eating, so I take a nap at noon every day

J sees L making coffee in the office pantry

Hey L, isn't that your third cup of coffee already
You know you shouldn't drink too much coffee, that is dehydrating, to say at least.

I know but I drink coffee whenever I need to be energized, but thanks for the reminder, I'll try to loosen my coffee consumption.

A and B are talking about their weekend activities
What do you do on weekends A?
I watch movies at home, what about you?
I hike with my friends and some of colleagues, you can come with us sometime
No thank you, I think weekdays are exhausting enough, that's why I stay at home and watch movies when I want to relax.
