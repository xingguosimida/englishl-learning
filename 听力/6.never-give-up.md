So never give up 

without commitment, you'll never start

but more importantly, without consistency, you'll never finish, it is not easy.

keep working, keep striving, never give up. Fall down seven times and get up eight

ease is greater threat to progress than hardship

so keep working, keep growing, keep learning, see you at work.
