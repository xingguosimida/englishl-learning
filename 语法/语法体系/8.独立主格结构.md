原句
Because the wolf invited him, the rabbit decided to go to the party.
修改后
The wolf inviting him, the rabbit decided to go to the party.

Invite这个动作是wolf发出的，而不是rabbit，但是rabbit却是整个句子的主语。所以wolf在这里是invite的逻辑主语，这就是独立主格中的主格，且wolf不是真正的主语，所以被认为是独立的，故称为独立主格。

独立主格可以简化从句，例如：

If the weather permits, the rabbit will go out.
The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out.

After the work was finished, the rabbit went home.
The work finished, the rabbit went home.

The rabbit is lying in bed and a carrot is still held in his hand.
The rabbit is lying in bed, a carrot is still held in his hand.

独立主格结构 -> 非谓语动词:
						1. 过去分词 （过去/被动）
						2. 现在分词 （现在/主动）
						3. 不定式（将要）
