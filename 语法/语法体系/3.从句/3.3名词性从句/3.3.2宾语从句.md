宾语从句中可能包含确定信息，也可能包含不确定信息。

> I saw that the rabbit ate a carrot

这里的 that the rabbit ate a carrot 就是一个宾语从句，这里的that就是一个确定的信息。

也有不确定的信息：
- I saw **whether** the rabbit ate the carrot.
- I saw **who** ate the carrot.
- I saw **what** the rabbit ate.
- I saw **where** the rabbit ate the carrot.
- I saw **when** the rabbit ate the carrot.
- I saw **how** the rabbit ate the carrot.

宾语从句的构成：
**引导词 + 正常的陈述语句**

**如果要表示否定的话，否定词往往加在谓语动词前，而不是在从句中。**

**在口语中宾语从句的that引导词往往可以省略。**

**宾语从句的时态要和主句保持一致**，除非从句中的内容是客观事实。
- I don't think (that) you are right.
- I didn't think (that) you were right.

I knew that the sun rises in the east.
