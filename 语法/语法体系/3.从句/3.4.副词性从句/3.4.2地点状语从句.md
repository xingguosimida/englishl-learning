引导词  where + “强调形式”

这里的强调形式就是 wherever anywhere everywhere

The rabbit ate the carrot where he found it.

与形容词从句的区别
The rabbit ate the carrot at the place where he found it. 形容词从句
定语从句修饰先行词place

而状语从句自己就是地点

This is where he found the carrot -> 表语从句
Where he found the carrot is a secret -> 主语从句

the rabbit will go wherever he can find a carrot
the rabbit will go where he can find a carrot
