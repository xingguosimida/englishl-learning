形容词有比较级，在句子中使用形容词的比较级时，通常就是比较状语从句

> He is smarter than me.

这是口语化的表达，实际上它的比较状语从句是
> He is smarter than I am

类似的还有：

This carrot is bigger than that one
This carrot is bigger than that one is

She is more beautiful than Snow White
She is more beautiful than Snow White is

也可以表示**同样**

He is as smart as I am
This carrot is as big as that one is
She is as beautiful as Snow White is、

也可以表示 **越...越...**

the + 比较级 , the + 比较级  

The more you practice english the more fluent you become.
The more coins you give me, the more videos I make.
