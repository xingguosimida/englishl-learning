# 形容词从句的思维方式

> The rabbit is eating a carrot.

扩充成

> 兔子在吃一根(我买来的)胡萝卜。

中文中的定语是直接放在被修饰的名词或代词之前。
英文中的定语是在被修饰的词之后，添加另一个和它有关系的词，然后再把这个新词放到另一个句子中进行补充说明或逻辑阐述。语法中，这个新词叫做关系词，被修饰的词叫做先行词，另一个句子就是定语从句。因为句子中包含了关系词，所以这种句子不仅被称作形容词从句，或者定语从句，也可以被称作关系从句。

> The rabbit is eating a carrot that I bought.

在这个例子中carrot就是先行词，that就是关系词，that I bought就是定语从句。

总结来说，中文中的定语都是前置的，而英语中的定语基本都是后置的。

# 形容词从句的构成
关系词分为 关系代词和关系副词

## 关系代词
- The rabbit is eating a carrot that I bought. 这里的that就是代词，所以是关系代词。
- The teacher who ate a carrot is rabbit.
- The teacher whom I saw yesterday is a rabbit.
- The teacher whose favourite food is carrot is a rabbit.
- The food which the teacher likes is a carrot.

除去关系代词在从句开头做引导词，其他词的语序与对应的陈述句是一致的

第一步，使用陈述句语序描述
上述例句中对应的陈述句为：
- I bought a carrot.
- The rabbit are a carrot.
-  I saw the teacher yesterday.
- The teacher's favourite food is carrot.
- The teacher likes the food.

第二步，将其替换成关系代词
- I bought that.
- Who ate a carrot.
-  I saw whom yesterday.
- whose favourite food is carrot.
- The teacher likes which.

第三步，再将代词前推，就构成了从句
- that I bought.
- Who ate a carrot.
- whom I saw yesterday.
- whose favourite food is carrot.
- which the teacher likes .
### That vs Which
在定语从句中，大多数情况下它俩可以相互替换，但是它们还是有一点小区别:
- 如果先行词是唯一的，那么使用that。
- 如果先行词是多选一的，那么使用which。

## 关系副词

- This was the place where the rabbit ate the carrot.
- This is the reason why the rabbit ate the carrot.
- This was the day when the rabbit ate the carrot for the first time.

也可以将上述的关系副词转换为关系代词：
- This was the place at where the rabbit ate the carrot.
- This is the reason for why the rabbit ate the carrot.
- This was the day on when the rabbit ate the carrot for the first time.

关系副词 = 介词 + 关系代词

[[3.2.1为什么 where when why是关系副词而不是关系代词]]

# 形容词从句的限定性和非限定性

上述定义从句的功能是为了对名词进行限定，这是定语从句的限定性。

定语从句也可以有非限定性，例如：
- The rabbit ate the carrot, the carrot was on the table.
- The rabbit ate the carrot, which was on the table.
这里的which只是为了让句子不太啰嗦。

- I have a head which is round(可能有好几个头，只是这个是圆的)
- I have a head, which is round(只有一个头，且它是圆的)

 所以，非限定性形容词从句总是做插入语，它可以是：
- 对先行词进行补充
	- My head, which is big, is useful when it rains.
- 指代整句话
	- The rabbit ate a carrot, which was not surprising.
