看起来像是动词，但是实际上被用作名词，形容词和副词。非谓语动词有三种形式：
- 动名词 **gerunds**
- 不定式 **infinitives**
- 分词 **participles**

# 动名词 gerunds
动名词通常以ing结尾，有名词的功能。
- Playing basketball takes up much of her time.  
- He gave up smoking three years ago.  
- His favourite pastime(消遣) is watching TV.  
- I am afraid of flying in an airplane.

# 不定式 infinitives
通常以 to + 动词原形组成，可以当做名词，形容词和副词。
- To play basketball for the Bulls is one of his biggest dreams.  
- I want to make you proud.  
- His goal was to run 3 km every day.  
- Baseball is an interesting game to watch.

# 分词 Participles
通常用作形容词，有现在分词和过去分词两种形式。

- The book is interesting.  
- The walking man is very tall.

- His neck was injured.  
- They put a brace on his injured neck to help it heal.


下面动词既可以搭配动名词也可以搭配不定式：
"begin," "hate," "start," "can't stand," "prefer," "continue", "can't bear," "neglect" and "love"

"remember," "stop," "try" and "regret"这些词在搭配动名词和不定式时有不同的意思
- ​**remember + doing**​（记得做过某事）→ 动作已完成
- ​**remember + to do**​（记得去做某事）→ 动作未完成，但被记住并执行
