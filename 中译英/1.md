昨天下午我和朋友一起去了一家新开的咖啡馆。那里的装修风格非常现代，墙上挂满了各种艺术画作。我们点了两杯拿铁和一块巧克力蛋糕，味道相当不错。服务员的态度也很友好，整个体验让人感到非常放松。

I went to a new opened cafe with my friends yesterday, the cafe was decorated with modern style, and there are lots of art painting hanging on the wall. We ordered two lattes and a piece of chocolate cake, that was really good. And the attitude of the waiters was very friendly, the whole experience makes me relaxed.

- "new opened" → 更地道的说法是"newly opened"或直接说"a new cafe"
	- （形容词+过去分词的结构中通常用副词修饰过去分词）
- the cafe was decorated with modern style
	- 更自然的表达：
		- 书面："The cafe had a modern decor"
		- 口语："The cafe was decorated in a modern style"
- there are lots of art painting
	- "there were many art paintings"
		- （时态一致+可数名词复数）
- that was really good
	- "The cake was delicious" 或 "It tasted wonderful"（避免用that单独指代食物）
- makes me relaxed
	- 时态问题："made me feel relaxed"（保持全文过去时一致）
