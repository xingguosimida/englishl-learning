With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there are many traditional industries are experiencing digital transition. Cloud compute and Big data analysis have developed the key utilities to for improving operation productivity to enterprises. However, the malicious risk is growing, enterprises need to protect sensitive data  by providing more resources.

1. 1.
    
    "there are many traditional industries are experiencing" 这个结构有问题，应该改为：
    
    "many traditional industries are experiencing" (去掉there are)
    
    更地道的表达："Numerous traditional industries are undergoing"
    
2. 2.
    
    "Cloud compute" 应该是 "Cloud computing"
    
    "Big data analysis" 首字母不需要大写，除非在标题中
    
3. 3.
    
    "have developed the key utilities to for improving" 这个部分比较混乱，建议改为：
    
    "have become key tools for improving"
    
    更流畅的表达："have emerged as essential tools for enhancing"
    
4. 4.
    
    "the malicious risk is growing" 可以更准确地表达为：
    
    "cybersecurity threats are also increasing"
    
    更专业的说法："cyber threats are proliferating"
    
5. 5.
    
    "by providing more resources" 建议改为：
    
    "by allocating more resources"
    
    更地道的商业用语："by investing more resources"
