上周六是我表妹的生日，我们全家二十多口人包下了火锅店的一个包间。尽管我姑姑再三提醒要准时，结果我叔叔还是迟到了半小时，因为他把车钥匙锁在了后备箱里。大人们边涮羊肉边聊房价和孩子的教育问题，而我们年轻人则偷偷在桌子底下刷手机，直到被爷爷发现挨了顿训。最搞笑的是，最后切蛋糕时才发现忘记带蜡烛，只好用打火机凑合着用。

Last Saturday was my cousin's birthday, roughly 20 people of our whole family ordered a room. My uncle late for half hour even though my aunt had reminder him several times, because he locked his car key in the trunk. The elders was discussing property price and child educating issue while boiling the mutton, but we youngster was checking mobile phones under the table until be caught by grandpa and got punished. The funniest this is that we forgot candles when cutting the cake, we have to use lighter instead. 

时态问题
- "ordered a room" → "had reserved a private room"（强调提前预定）
- "late for half hour" → "was half an hour late"（正确过去时）
- "had reminder him" → "had reminded him"（过去完成时动词形式）
冠词/单复数
- "the mutton" → "the lamb slices"（涮羊肉更地道的说法）
- "child educating issue" → "children's education"
语法结构
- "we youngster was checking" → "we youngsters were checking"（主谓一致）
- "until be caught" → "until we were caught"（被动语态完整形式）
- "we have to use" → "we had to use"（保持过去时一致）
文化词汇处理
- "包间" → "private dining room"比"a room"更准确
- "挨了顿训" → "got scolded"比"punished"更符合原文程度

修改后的版本：

"Last Saturday was my cousin's birthday. Our extended family of about 20 people had reserved a private dining room at a hot pot restaurant. Although my aunt had reminded everyone repeatedly to be on time, my uncle still arrived half an hour late because he'd locked his keys in the trunk. While the adults were cooking lamb slices and discussing property prices and children's education, we youngsters were secretly checking our phones under the table until Grandpa caught and scolded us. The funniest part was when we realized we'd forgotten candles for the cake and had to improvise with a lighter."
