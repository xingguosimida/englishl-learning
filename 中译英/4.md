尽管全球变暖已经成为不可否认的事实，但许多国家仍然没有采取足够的措施来应对这一危机。科学家们警告说，如果我们不立即减少温室气体排放，极端天气事件将会变得更加频繁。那些已经遭受海平面上升影响的小岛国，正在国际会议上强烈呼吁发达国家承担更多责任。

Even though the global warming becomes an undeniable fact, but many countries still not adapt enough measures to deal with this risk. The scientists warned that if we don't reduce the greenhouse gas instantly, the extreme weather event will be more frequency. Some small countries which affected by the sea levels rise are appealing that developed countries should take more responsibilities in international meetings 


你的翻译基本传达了原文意思，但在从句结构、时态和用词方面还有改进空间。以下是详细分析和修改建议：

1. 1.
    
    第一句问题：
    
    - •
        
        "becomes"应改为"has become"(现在完成时，表示已经发生且持续的状态)
        
    - •
        
        "but"需要去掉，因为"even though"已经表示让步，英语中不需要重复
        
    - •
        
        "adapt"应改为"adopt"(采用措施)，这是常见易混词
        
    - •
        
        "risk"不如"crisis"准确
        
    

修改后：

"Even though global warming has become an undeniable fact, many countries still have not adopted sufficient measures to address this crisis."

1. 1.
    
    第二句问题：
    
    - •
        
        "instantly"应改为"immediately"(表紧迫性更准确)
        
    - •
        
        "more frequency"形容词形式错误，应为"more frequent"
        
    - •
        
        建议添加"that"引导宾语从句更规范
        
    

修改后：

"Scientists have warned that if we don't immediately reduce greenhouse gas emissions, extreme weather events will become more frequent."

1. 1.
    
    第三句问题：
    
    - •
        
        "which affected"时态应为现在完成时"which have been affected"
        
    - •
        
        "sea levels rise"应为"rising sea levels"或"sea level rise"
        
    - •
        
        "appealing that"建议改为"strongly urging that"更准确
        
    - •
        
        "take more responsibilities"应为"take more responsibility"(不可数名词)
        
    

修改后：

"Some small island countries that have been affected by rising sea levels are strongly urging in international meetings that developed countries should take more responsibility."

完整修改版：

"Even though global warming has become an undeniable fact, many countries still have not adopted sufficient measures to address this crisis. Scientists have warned that if we don't immediately reduce greenhouse gas emissions, extreme weather events will become more frequent. Some small island countries that have been affected by rising sea levels are strongly urging in international meetings that developed countries should take more responsibility."

时态使用要点：

1. 1.
    
    表示已经发生的事实用现在完成时(has become)
    
2. 2.
    
    科学家的警告用现在完成时强调持续影响(have warned)
    
3. 3.
    
    受影响的国家用现在完成时强调已完成动作(have been affected)
    
4. 4.
    
    条件句用一般现在时表将来可能(don't reduce...will become)
